# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing. You control the style of displaying.  

## Resources

Find official guides on markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

(Shortcut key makes typing much more easier.

 E.g. <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>  can insert a link without typing"\[]()" )

## Typora (highly recommended)

There are many editors for Markdown. Here I recommend [Typora](https://www.typora.io/).

It gives you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer. A real ***live preview*** feature to help you concentrate on the content itself.

It also functions perfectly in transferring document types with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

# Git

## introduction

Different from SVN, Git is a ***distributed version control system***. 

("Git and GitHub" is just like "USB and USBhub".)

Before we get into any coding syntax, I think it necessary to understand how each part (repository, index, workspace and so on) works and interacts. 

The following pictures  might give a concrete interpretation on how Git works.

I remembered a few necessary and basic syntax for a quick start. 

And I plan to learn more later in practicing.

## Resources

Here I list some useful resources:

1. [Official Guides on Git](https://git-scm.com/docs)

2. [Runoob tutorial](https://www.runoob.com/git/git-workspace-index-repo.html) ( I recommend this one because it explains clearly how Git works and how each part interacts).

3. [Liao Xuefeng's guides](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600). 
4. Some easy-to-read tutorials from [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/41667536/answer/486640083?utm_source=qq&utm_medium=social&utm_oi=1007654303275831296&hb_wx_block=0). 



# Flask

Flask is a lightweight ***web application framework*** written in Python.

I did not get a deep insight into flask but a quick glance this week because it requires a basic mastering of Python, while I am still learning that. 

You may find this 45 minutes' **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA)** (VPN required) quite useful for a quick start.

**[Find Flask tutorials here.](http://docs.jinkan.org/docs/flask/)** I skimmed through the doc and completed the installation and necessary configures.
